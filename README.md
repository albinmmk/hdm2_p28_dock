Repository Overview

This repository contains code and resources for advanced analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results obtained using GROMACS.

Directory Structure

- **`codes/`**: This directory includes scripts used to perform further analysis of results from MD trajectories generated by GROMACS's built-in analysis modules.
  
  - A MATLAB script is provided for generating contact frequency maps from the MD data.
  - A custom colormap file is also included to enhance the visualization of these maps.


- **GROMACS**: Required for generating the initial MD trajectories.
- **MATLAB**: Necessary to run the contact frequency map script and apply the custom colormap.

### Usage

1. Run the provided MATLAB script to generate contact frequency maps from your GROMACS trajectory data.
2. Apply the included colormap file to visualize contact frequencies clearly and effectively.
